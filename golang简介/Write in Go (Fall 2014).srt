00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,660
The schedule’s tight on the cluster tonight
So I parallelized my code

2
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:32,240
All those threads and continuations
My head’s going to explode

3
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:40,200
And all that boilerplate
That FactoryBuilderAdapterDelegateImpl

4
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:47,000
Seems unjustified
Give me something simple

5
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,600
Don’t write in Scheme
Don’t write in C

6
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:55,689
No more pointers
that I forgot to free()

7
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:02,120
Java’s verbose
Python’s too slow

8
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,429
It’s time you know

9
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:09,640
Write in Go!
Write in Go!

10
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:12,920
No inheritance anymore

11
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:16,599
Write in Go!
Write in Go!

12
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,719
There’s no do or while,
just for

13
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:30,719
I don’t care what your linters say
I’ve got tools for that

14
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:33,640
The code never bothered me anyway

15
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:44,480
It’s funny how some features
Make every change seem small

16
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:52,120
And the errors that once slowed me
Don’t get me down at all

17
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:59,439
It’s time to see what Go can do
’Cause it seems too good to be true

18
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:07,079
No long compile times for me.
I’m free!

19
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,599
Write in Go!
Write in Go!

20
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,280
Kiss your pointer math goodbye

21
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:18,059
Write in Go!
Write in Go!

22
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:21,599
Time to give GC a try

23
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:31,690
I don’t care if my structures stay
On the heap or stack

24
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:46,240
My program spawns its goroutines
without a sound

25
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:53,039
Control is spiraling through
buffered channels all around

26
00:02:53,860 --> 00:03:00,120
I don’t remember why I ever once subclassed

27
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:03,080
I’m never going back

28
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,780
My tests all build and pass

29
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:11,559
Write in Go!
Write in Go!

30
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:15,039
You won’t use Eclipse anymore

31
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,260
Write in Go!
Write in Go!

32
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,280
Who cares what Boost is for?

33
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:28,200
I don’t care what the tech leads say

34
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:34,900
I’ll rewrite it all!

35
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:39,920
Writing code never bothered me, anyway.
